		<h1>Prose</h1>
			<p>From western Philadelphia I hail where in my youth I'd play upon the green 'til -rue the day! - I found myself assail'd by ruffianec contemptible and mean. Although the spat was trivial and brief, it wounded my death mother deep within; and so, to giver her conscience sweet relief, she sent me forth to live amongst her kin. When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, I came upon a coachman most unique; and yet, I simply took the trip and paid, despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique. I survey all the land with princely mien in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
